## Recent Technical Improvements *(August 2025)*

### JavaScript Integration Fixes
**Problem Solved**: Livewire morph hook errors causing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'canonical')` 

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced complex DOM polling with event-driven architecture
- Uses Livewire's `stripe-ready` event dispatched from PHP component
- Simplified JavaScript with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Eliminated blocking JavaScript errors while maintaining full functionality

### Payment Flow Optimization
**Problem Solved**: Stripe return_url construction errors and payment section visibility issues

**Solution Implemented**:
- Progressive disclosure: Payment section (Section 5) hidden initially, shown after payment method selection
- Event-driven Stripe Elements initialization triggered by `processCompleteOrder()` method
- Proper return URL construction using JavaScript variables instead of mixed Blade/JS syntax
- Improved button text: "Seleccionar método de pago" → triggers payment section, "Realizar pedido" → processes payment

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Single-page checkout**: All sections visible simultaneously instead of step-by-step navigation
- **Progressive payment**: Payment form appears dynamically when needed
- **Improved button flow**: Clear separation between payment method selection and payment processing
- **Better error handling**: Non-blocking errors with proper user feedback

### Technical Architecture Changes
```javascript
// Old approach (problematic)
Livewire.hook('morph.updated', (el, component) => {
    const newClientSecret = component.canonical.fingerprint.memo.data.clientSecret; // Error prone
});

// New approach (stable)
Livewire.on('stripe-ready', (event) => {
    const data = event[0] || event;
    if (data.clientSecret && data.orderNumber) {
        initializeStripe(data.clientSecret, data.orderNumber);
    }
});
```

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Livewire Integration**: Replaced morph hooks with native event system
2. **Return URL Construction**: Fixed JavaScript scope issues with proper variable declaration
3. **Payment Section Display**: Implemented progressive disclosure pattern
4. **Error Handling**: Added robust try-catch blocks and fallback mechanisms
5. **Button Text Updates**: Improved UX with clearer button labels and price placement
